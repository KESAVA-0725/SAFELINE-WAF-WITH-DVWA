# SAFELINE-WAF-WITH-DVWA
This project sets up SafeLine WAF with DVWA to test how a web application firewall detects and blocks attacks. After installing SafeLine, I performed SQL Injection, Command Injection, and HTTP Flood tests on DVWA to observe the WAF’s response. The setup shows how SafeLine protects vulnerable applications using rules and different security modes.
