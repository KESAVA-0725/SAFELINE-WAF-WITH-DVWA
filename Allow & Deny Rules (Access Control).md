# ⭐ 5. Allow & Deny Rules (Access Control)

SafeLine allows creating custom rules to control traffic:

# 🔸 What you configured:

* Allow Rules → Specific IPs or patterns always allowed

* Deny Rules → Specific IPs instantly blocked

# 🔸 Behavior:

* If a denied user attempts access, SafeLine immediately blocks with a security page.

* Allowed users bypass WAF screening based on your rules.

* This showcases SafeLine’s granular IP-based firewalling.
